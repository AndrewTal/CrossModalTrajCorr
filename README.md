## How to install
Follow the steps below to create and activate the environment, and install the project dependencies:
```python
conda create --name trajspace python=3.10
conda activate trajspace
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Patch-based feature extraction
Note that you need to download all required datasets and pretrained models by yourself using the links provided at the end, and update the corresponding paths before running the scripts.

You can use the following commands to extract image patches from the HEST dataset, either at the spot size or at a fixed resolution:
```python
python preprocessing/patch_extractor.py
```

For standard architectures such as ResNet18 and ViT-B/16, we leverage the [timm](https://huggingface.co/timm) library. For other specialized models, we use the [Trident](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/TRIDENT) framework. You can use the following commands to extract features:

```python
python preprocessing/feature_extractor.py
```


## Filtered data

Run the code to process the filtered sample data:

```
python pesudotime/dataset_process.py
```

## Pseudotime calculation

The sample is based on ST data and pseudotime calculation based on image features:

```
python pesudotime/Cal_PT.py
```


## Pseudotime-based gene enrichment

Enrichment of genes based on pseudo-time trajectory:

```
python pesudotime/Gene_Enrich.py
```


## Visualized genes
The spatial distribution of visualized genes:

```
python pesudotime/Gene_Expression.py
```


## Pathology to spatial transcriptomics
For the pathology-to-spatial transcriptomics prediction task, we adopt the method proposed in the [MISO](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-66691-y) paper.
The official implementation is available at [here](https://github.com/owkin/miso_code).
